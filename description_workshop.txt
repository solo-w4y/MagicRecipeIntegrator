[h1]⚠ Achtung! ⚠[/h1]

I created this mod because I needed to see available recipes using items in Magic Storage—**and that’s exactly what it does**.  

:small_orange_diamond: **Magic Storage UI must be open** for recipe calculations to work.  
:small_orange_diamond: **This mod only shows recipes.**  
:small_orange_diamond: **You cannot craft directly** from Recipe Browser using this mod.

This is my first mod, and I have **no prior C# experience**, so expect bugs!
