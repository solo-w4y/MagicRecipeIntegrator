[h1]⚠ Achtung! ⚠[/h1]

I created this mod because I needed to see available recipes using items in Magic Storage—[b]and that’s exactly what it does[/b].

🔹 [b]Magic Storage UI must be open[/b] for recipe calculations to work.
🔹 [b]This mod only shows recipes.[/b]
🔹 [b]You cannot craft directly[/b] from Recipe Browser using this mod.
