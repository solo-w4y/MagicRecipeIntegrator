# RecipeBoxer  

A simple mod that enables the **"Magic Storage"** checkbox in the **Recipe Browser** craft tab.  

## ⚠️ Achtung!!! ⚠️  

I just needed to see available recipes using items stored in **Magic Storage**, and that's exactly what this mod does.  

- **Magic Storage UI must be open** for recipe calculations to work.  
- **Only shows recipes** – crafting directly from Recipe Browser is **not possible**.  

## 🔹 How to Use  

1. Enable **"Magic Storage"** checkbox in the **"Craft"** tab of Recipe Browser.  
2. Open **Magic Storage**.  
3. Put some items inside.  
4. Enable **"Extended Craftable"** filter in Recipe Browser **"Recipes"** tab.  
5. See if it works!

My first mod and **no prior C# experience**, so bugs are expected!  

Huge thanks to the **Magic Storage** and **Recipe Browser** authors for making such great mods! 🎉
